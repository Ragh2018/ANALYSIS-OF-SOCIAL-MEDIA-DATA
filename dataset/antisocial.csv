anti social elements in the name of students
I teach three students diagnosed with mental illness and a couple of blatantly hostile and anti-social ones. My school won't get shot up. Why? Because I live in a place that loves kids more than guns.

These students were anti trump liberals before the shooting which can be seen throughout social media except for some taken down before the date of Feb14
"""Students Invention aimed at ""anti-social"" pub customers"" http://ow.ly/y6SC30irUXg "
Students around the three kids (whether they knew them personally or had classes with them) started to feel suspicious of them. They had suddenly become very anti-social when before they were one with the rest. Red Flag.
"How about incorporating anti bullying classes in schools, teach love, acceptance. Engage students in social settings..."

I don’t believe it. ABVP is a responsible student organisation and would not indulge in physical assault on participants of a panel discussion on such a topic. This matter needs to be investigated. I guess some anti-social elements did it with ABVP slogans to give ABVP a bad name
Students need to put down their cell phones a meet the people sitting next to them. Cell phones have made this Country anti-social.
The Student lead protests R about indoctrination not solutions. No plan-slick social media-twitter verifications-continually talk about “celebrities” that gave $ to their cause (“them”). Their making it cool to be anti potus so that others will want to immolate them. #QAnon #MAGA

Well CNN et al have given a platform to the rabid anti gun students who are now trending all over social media. I’m sure he’s heard their irrational cries
"I Called the Douglas High Shooting a Credibly anti-Semitic Attack. The Response? An anti-Semitic Deluge - From personal experience, the response, at least on social media, is a deluge of vicious anti-Semitism. Personal accounts of students who attende... http://ow.ly/wRNs50gAn0r "
"Arming teachers with guns so they can accidentally kill the students vs just banning guns.

Imagine contorting yourself like that because that’s the hill you want to die on.

Apropos, at what point do they become so anti-social that everyone decides that is the hill they die on?"
"Solutions to school shootings is complex. It requires teachers to be trained in recognizing & preventing anti-social behavior, training students about inclusion, some teachers in concealed carry & how to respond, more & better security & plans. #MAGApic.twitter.com/srDaf2JgRi"

Watching anti-social psychopath Trump bobble head through the articulate questions & comments from the students is so nauseating. Hopefully one day we’ll have a real president again who truly cares about others & has the answers. #ParklandStudentsSpeak #GunControlNow #NeverAgain
"Wow, I haven't reflected on this experience in a long time.

Three students (myself included) had desks thrown at us + death threats for shutting down an ""anti-Arab"" rally that erupted out of a post-9/11 social studies class."
Verified the boy/actor/student who just opened his Twitter account on the 14th and has fewer followers than you. The anti-2nd Amendment crowd is well funded and supported by all the social media giants. https://twitter.com/cameron_kasky

"Florida teacher Mella Baxter on now talking abt school shooting.
She said we should start screening the students at a younger age for mental and anti social behavior. That's not a solution.  They do that now and are paid to evaluate our children's behavior"
"Even in schools in solid-red counties, the political atmosphere is anti-Trump, anti-gun, anti-libertarian and pro-socialist. Social Justice clubs and LGBT clubs are in every school. When the name ""Trump"" is uttered by students, it is with disdain. No kid wants to be unpopular."

".@FLOTUS  -- Supporting the Parkland students and publicly chastising the people abusing & bullying them on social media would be a good start to your anti-bullying campaign.

And it should be outrageous that theresa may wants to censor social media for fear of anti right wing pro socialost voews being aired. It works both ways. As long as done appropriately students should be allowed to debate and think critically.

"Yes Media is prone to exploit children whenever the opportunity arises. Public school students are easy targets for propaganda & social experiments. The reporters are  gleefully leading Parkland students in an anti -Trump parade filled with untruths,half truths, and ugly hatred."
School sizes are so big that students typically feel alienated thus creating strong anti social feelings. Force the school system back to the local level. Cease all federal funding for K1-K12. Let the local tax oayers decide funding and curriculum.
