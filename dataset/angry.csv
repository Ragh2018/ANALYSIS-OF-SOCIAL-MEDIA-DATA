Did you see the irony in this too? The teachers can't get school supplies yet find money to purchase a AR-15 which helps gun sales to a angry person who in turns comes into the school to kill the teachers and their students.

Yup Mr LaPierre is too chicken to face angry but self disciplied students. A bit of advice. Their discipline may slip before their anger. Remember the feeling when your parents failed to keep you safe?
As the parent of a MSD student I am  so angry! This is the perfect storm of ineptitude.

Precisely why arming more people in a school doesn't make things safer. Limiting high powered assault rifles from getting into the hands of angry students does.
"Does that line up of students look like it's a protest in Britain to you? So many hijabs; so many angry hateful faces. This is not diversity any more, this is Western culture being swamped by antisemitic lying Islamists."
What about a non-violent student who has to fear that an angry teacher will pull out a gun and shoot up the place. More guns equals more deaths.

Makes no sense on any level. Where would their guns be stored? How quickly could they be reached if a situation developed? How to stop students taking the opportunity to get their hands on a teacher's gun for a joke or if they're momentarily angry about something?
So what date do the stories start of students who fooled the teacher to take the gun from them. An angry student fighting a teacher and the teacher draws the gun on a student on self defense?
